<h1>CalWriter Help</h1>
<p>The sidebar shows a collapsible tree of all your books, sub-folders and chapters. A search box lets you find text anywhere and the tree remembers which items you have expanded or collapsed.</p>
<p>Chapters open in tabs grouped by book. Each book can have its own tab color and books, sub-folders and chapters can be closed to hide them from view.</p>
<p>Chapters and notes save automatically as you type. The toolbar offers bold, italics, underline, lists, indent/outdent, horizontal lines, undo/redo and a find/replace tool. A pre-edit mode lets you mark text with icon tags.</p>
<p>Use drag and drop to reorder chapters or folders. Download a single chapter or combine all chapters—including closed ones—from the book page. The stats page tracks your daily word counts.</p>
<p>Colors and dark mode can be customized in App Settings and reset to the defaults at any time.</p>
