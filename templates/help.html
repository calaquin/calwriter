<h1>CalWriter Help</h1>
<p>CalWriter keeps your projects organized in books with unlimited folders and chapters. Start a new book from the home page or open an existing one to continue writing.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Editing</strong> – Chapters open in tabs grouped by book. The rich text toolbar offers formatting, lists, undo/redo and find/replace. Notes and chapters save automatically.</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation</strong> – The sidebar tree can be collapsed or expanded and remembers its state. Drag and drop folders or chapters to rearrange them. Right click items to rename or delete.</li>
  <li><strong>Import/Export</strong> – Use <em>Export Database</em> to save a <code>.calwdb</code> archive or <em>Download Database as a .zip</em> for backups. <em>Import Database</em> merges an archive into your data.</li>
  <li><strong>Book Wizard</strong> – Quickly create a book with starter folders and the first chapter.</li>
  <li><strong>Stats and Search</strong> – Search across all books and track daily word counts on the Stats page.</li>
  <li><strong>Customization</strong> – Choose colors for book tabs, enable dark mode and adjust editor background in App Settings. Pre-edit mode lets you insert icon tags with a click.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapters can be exported to <code>.docx</code> files individually or combined from the book page. When you're done for the day, export or download your database to keep everything safe.</p>
