<h1>About CalWriter</h1>
<img src="/assets/logo.png" alt="CalWriter Logo" class="about-logo" />
<p>CalWriter began as a small experiment with Flask and quickly grew into a
lightweight writing application. It was designed to keep your work organized in
a simple folder structure while still providing basic word processor tools.</p>

<p>The goal is to let writers focus on their stories without complicated menus or
cloud logins. All data lives in a persistent directory so you can rebuild the
container or move it to another machine without losing any chapters.</p>

<p>CalWriter is open source and continually evolving with small improvements.
